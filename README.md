# Project-1
The purpose of this project was to initially create a clock the displays the time in minutes and hours for a coffee machine. It also helps create the function in which the coffee machine will run on, including the flowchart and reading user input. I think I particularly followed the flowchart pretty well  as well as creating myown flow chart and psuedo code that closely resembled what actions the coffee machine needed to do. To enhance the code, there coudl've been better methods used in terms of how to code it. Furhter along the class we learned the python can be integrated into C++ and for this I would have been more than happy to integrate some pythong within this code.The most annoying thing to code was to honestly, for me when coding anything, is the repitition you sometimes have to do in order to make syure you have all basis of the code and outcomes covered. The only way to overcome this is to jsyut tredge on and get it down honestly. I think all skills from this project will be transfeerred to most future projects with the addition of other code language integration. I think overall, this project is very readable and well structured for the first project for the module.
